To be able to analyze a C/C++ project with
[LLVM Datalog](https://github.com/plast-lab/llvm-datalog), we must
generate a single *whole-program*
[LLVM bitcode](http://llvm.org/releases/2.6/docs/BitCodeFormat.html)
file. Many such projects are built with
[Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)
though, so we must manually tweak the build process to do that.

In what follows, I describe the necessary steps for compiling
[GNU coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html)
so that we end up with a single LLVM bitcode file per coreutil command
(instead of an executable file), but the process should be roughly the
same for other autotooled software as well.


### Prerequisites ###

1. Check that the
   [gold linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(linker)) is
   installed on your system. On Fedora, it is normally installed under
   `/usr/bin/ld.gold`. We could change the default linker (i.e., `ld`)
   to point to `ld.gold` by using
   [alternatives](http://linux.die.net/man/8/alternatives), but it is
   *not* necessary.

2. Verify that `ld.gold` accepts *plugin* arguments by running:

    ~~~
    $ ld.gold -plugin
    ~~~

    You should see a warning such as `-plugin: missing argument`.

3. Verify that your LLVM installation contains the
   [gold plugin](http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html) (look for
   `lib/LLVMgold.so` under the main LLVM directory that also contains
   `bin/clang`). This is probably *not* the case for LLVM prebuilt
   binaries, so you may need to compile LLVM from source (see next
   [section](#compiling-llvm-from-source-with-gold-plugin)).


### Compiling LLVM from source <small>with gold plugin</small> ###

See the [Getting Started](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html)
page on how to build LLVM. Choose the `"Unix Makefiles"` as a
generator. In order to build the gold plugin, you also need to specify
the path to `plugin-api.h` of *binutils* (which you may also need to
build). The command to build LLVM should be something similar to:

~~~ console
$ cd /path/to/llvm/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR=/path/to/binutils/include ../llvm/
~~~

Building will take a long time, but when it is over it should have created
`lib/LLVMgold.so`.

Now you should be able to create whole program binaries via
`clang`. By applying the `-flto` flag while compiling, you create an
LLVM bitcode file instead of an object file. Then you need to pass the
`emit-llvm` plugin option to the gold linker, so that it, too,
generates bitcode instead of an executable. Test the previous scenario
on a trivial single file C project by running:

~~~ console
$ clang -flto -c test.c
$ file test.o
test.o: LLVM IR bitcode
$ clang -flto -fuse-ld=gold -Wl,-plugin-opt=emit-llvm test.o
$ file a.out
a.out: LLVM IR bitcode
~~~


### Building GNU coreutils with GNU autoconf ###

So now, all we have to do is override some environment variables used
by the compiling and linking commands that will be generated by the
`configure` script of coreutils.

Almost. The thing is that `configure` makes many complicate tests that
actually require that linking generates an *executable* file. LLVM
bitcode is not executable, however.

You may be tempted to change the `configure` script so that it tries
to execute the bitcode file with
[`lli`](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lli.html), which is an
interpreter for LLVM bitcode. Do not go down that road though, since
it requires understanding and then performing various changes all over
an intricate, autogenerated, and not that human friendly gigantic
bourne script of about 70k lines!

It is much easier to first run the `configure` script so that it
generates normal *executable* files by clang (so that it passes the
tests) and then slightly change the linking command of the generated
Makefile, to add the aforementioned plugin option.

To recap:

1. Setup your environment and run `./configure`.

    ~~~ console
    $ export CC=clang
    $ export CXX=clang++
    $ export RANLIB=llvm-ranlib
    $ export CFLAGS=" -flto -std=gnu99 "
    $ export LDFLAGS=" -flto -fuse-ld=gold "
    $ ./configure
    ~~~

2. Open the generated `Makefile`, locate the initialization of the
   `LDFLAGS` variable, and change it so that it includes the plugin
   option to emit LLVM bitcode. It should now look like:

    ~~~ make
    LDFLAGS =  -flto -fuse-ld=gold -Wl,-plugin-opt=emit-llvm
    ~~~

3. At some point, there used to be an `also-emit-llvm` plugin option,
   which generated *both* an executable and a bitcode file. I do not
   see such an option at `LLVM 3.7.0`, however. Had it been there, we
   could just set the `LDFLAGS` to its final value *before* calling
   `./configure`, and leave `Makefile` unchanged.

    ==UPDATE== Turns out this option still exists but has been renamed
    to `save-temps`. So if you want to create both normal executables
    and bitcode files, skip the previous step and try instead:

    ~~~ console
    $ ...
    $ export LDFLAGS=" -flto -fuse-ld=gold  -Wl,-plugin-opt=save-temps "
    $ ./configure
    ~~~

4. And now it's time to compile GNU coreutils at last!

    ~~~ console
    $ make
    ~~~

    The build may fail at some point near the testing stage, but it should
    have already generated all our precious *whole-program* LLVM
    bitcode coreutils, nonetheless.

5. Verify that this is indeed the case by sampling the
   `src/` directory. E.g.:

    ~~~ console
    $ file src/who
    src/who: LLVM IR bitcode
    ~~~

6. (Optional) To rename all the whole-program generated bitcode files
   (adding the standard `.bc` suffix) and gather them to some `out/`
   directory, run:

    ~~~ console
    $ mkdir out/
    $ for i in `find src/ -type f -not -name '*.o' -maxdepth 1`
    > do [[ $(file -b $i) = "LLVM IR bitcode" ]] && cp $i ${i/src/out}.bc
    > done
    ~~~

And now we are done!
