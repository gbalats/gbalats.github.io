      <h3>Automatic Bytecode Disassembly</h3>
      <p>Program analysis often requires manual inspection of
        not just the source code but the actual IR that is
        passed to the static analysis tool. Most of the times
        this intermediate representation is a compressed
        format such as Java bytecode.
      </p>
      <p> Thus, to open an Emacs buffer containing Java
        bytecode for instance, one first needs to run a
        command that disassembles the file, and then he may
        open its disassembled contents.
      </p>
      <p>Things are even worse when such a file is part of an
        archive (e.g., inside a jar file). Then you have to
        extract it first too.
      </p>

      <p>This is a task that can be easily automated by emacs,
        assuming your system is properly configured and the
        actual disassembler commands are included in your PATH
        (e.g., javap).
      </p>

      <p>To that end, I wrote these two simple Emacs
        extensions that handle the task for (i)
        <a href="https://github.com/gbalats/autodisass-java-bytecode">
          Java Bytecode
        </a> and (ii)
        <a href="https://github.com/gbalats/autodisass-llvm-bitcode">
          LLVM Bitcode
        </a>.
